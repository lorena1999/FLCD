ConfigurationClass -> the state could have been initialized in place instead of element by element ( more efficient )
		   -> used lists instead of stack objects for the two stacks

PIF.out -> neat 

our.in -> nice syntax

main.py -> menu is commented out on lines 31 - 62
	-> descendant instead of descendad
	

Descendand.py -> you could rather try converting "number" directly from the start to integer instead of doing it 8 times in the "another_try" function
	      -> in python you should use "is True" instead of "== True"
	      
Parser.py -> clean validation

grammar.in -> on line 11, for each function argument, after the first, there will be too many paranthesis
for example:
( int a ) - one argument 
( int a , ( int b ) ) - two arguments 
( int a , ( int b , ( int c ) ) ) - three arguments
