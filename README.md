pb2.txt is the file from which the program takes its sample code in order to scan it and to
detect the errors

problems.txt is a file where I put some LEXICALY CORRECT programs in order to perform some 
other tests for the scanner

wrong.txt is a file where I put some problems which are WRONG from the lexical point of view
The first problem from wrong.txt has an identifier which starts with a digit => error
The second problm from wrong.txt has an integer with more than one digit that starts with
0 => error
The third problem from wrong.txt has a double quote which doesn't close => error
